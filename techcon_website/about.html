                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>TechCon began in 2012 as a small regional meetup for technology enthusiasts and early-stage innovators. 
                    Its founders envisioned a platform where developers, researchers, and industry leaders could exchange 
                    ideas and showcase emerging technologies. Over the years, TechCon expanded into a global conference, 
                    drawing thousands of participants annually. <br> By 2016, the conference had introduced specialized 
                    tracks on artificial intelligence, cloud computing, robotics, and cybersecurity. The addition of hands-on 
                    workshops in 2018 strengthened its reputation as a practical learning hub. In recent years, 
                    TechCon has embraced virtual and hybrid models, increasing accessibility and participation from diverse 
                    regions. Today, it stands as a premier event that highlights cutting-edge innovation, fosters collaboration, 
                    and shapes the future of technology worldwide.
